Data Structure with thr first in, first out property. (fifo)

Operations:
    Insert (Push): Putting an item into the end of the queue.
    Peek: Look at first item of the queue.
    Remove (Pop): Remove the first item of the queue.

Deque: double ended queue - Inserting and removing can be done on both ends.

Implementation
    Use an array and two pointers - one pointing at the start and one at the end.
    When inserting an item into the queue, we set the entry at the end pointer to the value and increase the ned pointer by one.
    When removing an item from the queue, we increase the start pointer by one.

    For a Deque, same logic but both pairs of start/end pointers are decremented/incremented 

    When one of the queue pointers reaches the end of the array, it will cause an overflow. If some elements have
    been removed from the other end, when the queue overflows, there is unused space which is not ideal.

    Fix: Circular Buffer: When a pointer tries to move past the array, it loops around to the other end of the array isntead.
